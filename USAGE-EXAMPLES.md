## üìù Natural Language Tips

Claude understands many ways to ask for the same thing:

### Different Ways to Say "Show Projects"
- "List my projects"
- "What projects am I working on?"
- "Show me all active projects"
- "Display current projects"
- "Can you get my project list?"

### Time Entry Variations
- "Log 8 hours to ABC today"
- "I worked 8 hours on project ABC"
- "Add 8h to ABC for today"
- "Submit time: 8 hours, project ABC"

### Being Specific vs General
- General: "Show me projects" (gets all)
- Specific: "Show me active projects over $100k starting this month"

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Test with basic queries before complex ones
2. **Be Specific**: Include project IDs when you know them
3. **Use Dates**: "last week", "this month", "Q4 2024" all work
4. **Batch Similar Tasks**: "Show me all timesheets then approve TS-001, TS-002"
5. **Save Common Queries**: Keep a note of queries you use often

## üö´ What Won't Work

These are outside the scope of the MCP server:

- "Delete all projects" (no delete operations for safety)
- "Change another user's timesheet" (only your permissions)
- "Access payroll data" (if not in Unanet API)
- "Modify system settings" (read-only for most config)
