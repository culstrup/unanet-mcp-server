## üí¨ Outreach Message Templates

### For Unanet Administrators
```
Subject: Cut Unanet time entry from 15 min to 30 seconds

Hi [Name],

I noticed you're a Unanet administrator at [Company]. We've built an AI integration that lets users interact with Unanet using natural language - imagine typing "submit 8 hours to project ABC" instead of clicking through forms.

Early users report 1-2 hours saved daily. Would you be interested in a 15-minute demo?
```

### For CFOs/Controllers
```
Subject: Save $1M+ annually on Unanet operations

Hi [Name],

Your team probably spends 30-60 minutes daily navigating Unanet. Our Claude AI integration reduces common tasks to seconds using natural language.

For a 100-person company, that's $1.25M in annual productivity gains. Worth a quick conversation?
```

### For Implementation Partners
```
Subject: Partnership: AI-powered Unanet implementations

Hi [Name],

We've built an MCP integration that makes Unanet 10x easier to use via Claude AI. Your clients implementing Unanet could see dramatic adoption improvements.

Interested in being the first partner to offer AI-enhanced Unanet?
```

## üìä Market Intelligence

### Key Pain Points to Address:
1. **User adoption** - Especially after switching from legacy systems
2. **Time entry efficiency** - Major complaint across all users

4. **Month-end close time** - One customer reduced by 65%
5. **DCAA compliance** - Easier timesheet submission = better compliance

### Competitive Intelligence:
- 70% of Unanet customers chose it over Deltek
- 1/3 switched from competitors (mainly Deltek)

### Pricing Context:
- Unanet licenses: $50-100/user/month

## üöÄ Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Direct Outreach (Immediate)
1. Contact Jennifer Wynn - she influences multiple clients
2. Reach out to recent implementers (BlueHalo, MDR, etc.)
3. Connect with Katie Donnell at Redstone

### Phase 2: Partner Channel (Month 2)

2. Propose partnership model
3. Get on Champions Conference agenda

### Phase 3: Unanet Partnership (Month 3)
1. Contact Ryan Craig (COO) with success stories

Remember: The #1 value prop is TIME SAVINGS. Every demo should show:
- "Submit 40 hours to project ABC this week" = 5 seconds vs 15 minutes
- "Show all projects over budget" = instant vs running reports
- "What's our cash position?" = CEO gets instant answer
